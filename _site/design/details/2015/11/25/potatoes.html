      <p>I’ve been thinking a lot recently about taking care of myself and being a basic human. It’s so easy to throw yourself into work or get caught up in something on the side that you really want to do. When I do that I don’t eat healthy, I don’t sleep well, and I don’t exercise.</p>

<p>I’m learning more and more that having those things in my life make me a better person at work. I’m better at my job if I can get up and exercise in the morning or if I don’t eat a shitty lunch or something like that. So I’m thinking a lot about that. It’s not really keeping me up at night, maybe more like forcing me to go to bed and not stay up late at night. I go to bed at 10pm, it’s pretty great, and get up at 6am and work out or go for a run. I’m trying be an adult but I think it also makes me really happy.</p>

<p>Over the summer instead of signing up for another weird project or doing more design work on the side, I signed up for a half-marathon and I train for that every day. I think it’s about finding those side projects that maybe aren’t helping my design [directly], but are helping my design in another way. I’m constantly trying to think how can I be a functional human being, and also a designer. I feel like a lot of people don’t think about those things as much. It doesn’t have to be mutually exclusive.</p>
